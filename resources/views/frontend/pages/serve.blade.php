        <h5 class="text-primary">Himalaya Salt</h5>
        <p class="text-justify">
            At Swaad we cook with Himalaya salt which makes the taste unmatched. Pink Himalayan salt comes from seabed
            and although commonly referred to as a spice, this product is actually a mineral. It is a natural, very
            coarse-grained salt and contains many minerals. In raw form it contains negligible amounts of calcium,
            magnesium, potassium, sulfates, and moisture; it also contains iron, zinc, copper, manganese, chromium, and
            lead as trace elements. Pink salt is used the same way table salt would be used in cooking and baking.
            However, Himalayan pink salt is higher in mineral content than traditional table salt. It is considered a
            true gourmet cooking salt by top chefs. It also adds an interesting pink color and different texture to
            foods which can bring something special to your Plate/Table. This salt is a wonderful ingredient in
            grilling, cooking, roasting and seasoning foods.

        <h4 class="text-primary">Turmeric</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">
            Having an earthy odor, turmeric has a pungent flavor. It has a little bitter, peppery like mustard and a
            slight ginger flavor in it. Turmeric is used for cooking and also as a coloring agent. An Indian spicy
            recipe without turmeric may not have the desired flavor of the dish. In India, it is commonly called as
            Haldi. <br>
            Turmeric is widely grown for its rhizomes which are consumed as a bright yellow-orange cooking spice.
            Curcumin is the chief pigment in turmeric and is usually used in a variety of food industries as a coloring
            agent. Turmeric is primarily used in dairy foods, cereals, beverages, cereal, ice cream, bakery products and
            savory foodstuffs. It is also used in flavored milk drinks, refined milk, desserts, and confectionaries to
            attain lemon and banana colors in dairy products. <br>
            At greater levels, turmeric is added to sausages, pickles, relishes, sauces, and dry mixes due to its unique
            convention as a spice. Storage of turmeric should be in sealed air-tight containers away from sunlight. If
            not stored properly, turmeric can lose its aroma quickly. It is mainly contained in curry powders and to
            give a good flavor to rice dishes and sauces. <br>
            Turmeric also contains flavonoid curcumin, well-known for its anti-inflammatory properties. As per medical
            reports, turmeric detoxifies the liver, fights allergies, stimulates digestion and boosts immunity. In the
            early days, women used to have a bath using a paste of turmeric and oil (ubtan) as it is good for the skin.
